We used Plotly, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create data visualizations that are attractive, accessible, and interactive. Libraries like Plotly offer interactivity, which can help audience better understand data and draw the same conclusions. With the use of JavaScript to enhance the interactive features of my visualizations by building out buttons and dropdown menus. I build my own JavaScript foundation to manipulate, parse, transform, and retrieve data from external sources like csv files and APIs. Finally, I deployed a polished data visualization to the web, all using the power of JavaScript. Introduced to the fundamentals of JavaScript by creating basic charts with the Plotly library. I learned how to store data using variables, objects, and arrays in JavaScript. Then, after I understand the basic concepts in JavaScript, I created a corresponding chart in Plotly. Next, how to control flow with iterations and conditionals by using JavaScript. Used Plotly to create multiple traces and the data array object that generates multiple trace charts. Finally, used functions in JavaScript and apply the knowledge to an activity where I used Plotly to create a barchart to visualize data about movie ratings.
